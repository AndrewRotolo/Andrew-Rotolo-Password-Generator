# Andrew Rotolo's Random Password Generator

## Description

The random password generator creates a random string of characters with a length between 8 and 128 as defined by the user. User can individually specify whether to allow or disallow uppercase letters, lowercase letters, single-digit numbers, and special characters. The generator will then produce a password fitting the selected requirements. This process can be repeated as many times as is necessary

## Installation

## Usage

**IMPORTANT NOTE - PLEASE READ:** This application was made for educational purposes and should not be used as an actual security measure. The internal generator uses javaScript's Math.random() function, which is not cryptographically secure. Please do not use this application to create passwords you intend to use.
